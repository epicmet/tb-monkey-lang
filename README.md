This is just my playground to work learn [Throsten Balls books](https://interpreterbook.com/)

It's literally a copy of the Monkey language implemenatation in the book (maybe) with minor changes.

Exersises:

- Attach filename \& column and row number to tokens for better error logging
- Support full UTF-8 instead of only ASCII
